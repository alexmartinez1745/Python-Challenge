## Background
Tools used: Python programming

## PyBank

* Created a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a company. The set of financial data used is called [budget_data.csv](PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv). The dataset is composed of two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`.

* End goal:

  * Calculate the total number of months included in the dataset.

  * The total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.

  * Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of the changes.

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

  * Final script will output into a text file after being run (as well as in the terminal). 

* The final outcome is shown in the Pybank folder: [Final-Finance-Analysis](PyBank/Analysis/SumAnalysis.txt)

## PyPoll

* Python script was made to help a small town modernize its vote counting process. 

* The set of poll data used was called [election_data.csv](PyPoll/Resources/election_data.csv). The dataset is composed of three columns: `Voter ID`, `County`, and `Candidate`. 

* End goal after analyzing votes:

  * Calculate the total number of votes casted.

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes.

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won.

  * The total number of votes each candidate won.

  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.

  * Final script will output into a text file after being run (as well as in the terminal).

* The final outcome is shown in the PyPoll folder: [Final-Poll-Analysis](PyPoll/Analysis/SummaryAnalysis.txt)
